# TunesControl
Priority management for pausing and playing desktop music applications

This is a work in progress. 



My goals with this application are:


-Make a mini mediaplayer that hooks into Spotify's API.

-Detect other common, currently running media players (Spotify, iTunes, WMP)

-Have options to choose your keybindings

-Have a config file that saves keybindings

-Choose to prioritize your keybindings on a certain media player. 

-Can use a modifier key, such as LeftControl, in combination with another keybinding to use a non-default player.
